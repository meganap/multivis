			<h3>Definitions (defined terms in the survey questions are indicated by a <b>*</b>)</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>A <b>sample</b> refers to one physical sample that was taken from an individual. A sample contains a unique community of microbes.</li>
					<li>An <b>individual</b> refers to a human or animal from which one or multiple samples were taken.</li>
					<li>A <b>taxon</b> is group or category of living organisms linked by common ancestry.</li>
					<li><b>Diversity</b> reflects the number of distinct organisms in a sample, as well as how equally abundant those organisms are.  A highly diverse sample will be one with many organisms, no single one of which dominates in abundance.</li>
					<li>Two groups are <b>similar</b> if they are similar in both abundance and type of present organisms.</li>

					<li>An <b>individual</b> refers to a human or animal from which one or multiple samples were taken.</li>
					<li>A <b>phylogeny</b> is an inferred evolutionary relationship between organisms.</li>
					<li>A <b>phylogenetic tree</b> is a visual representation of the inferred evolutionary relationships between organisms.</li>
					<li><b>Branch length</b> is a representation of evolutionary time. Long branch length between organisms means that there has been a long time since those organisms diverged from a common ancestor. As an example, humans have a more recent common ancestor with a chimp than with a dog, and so the human and the dog would be separated by more branch length on a phylogenetic tree.</li>
					<li><b>Closely related</b> in terms of phylogeny means that organisms are closer to each other in evolutionary time.</li>
					<li><b>Depth</b> refers to the amount of evolutionary history represented by an ancestor (taxon) and all its descendants. A taxon that is deep has many changes through evolutionary time.</li>

					<li>An <b>individual</b> refers to a human or animal from which one or multiple samples were taken.</li>
					<li>A <b>principal coordinate</b> is a numerical representation that describes the similarity of samples. It is often mapped to an axis in a visual representation. The first principle coordinate describes the most difference between samples.</li>
					<li><b>Spread</b> in principal coordinate space refers to the closeness of samples. Samples that have more spread are farther away from each other in space.</li>
					<li>If two samples are closer to each other in space then their communities are <b>closely related/similar</b>.</li>
